ActiGlobe is designed to make it easy to pre-process longitudinal actigraphy recordings, especially for the recordings affected by time shift due to daylight saving changes and or cross-continental travel. It streamlines the process from end-to-end, to simplify the process of pre-processing, analyzing, and exporting daily actigraphy data and visual reports, making it an essential tool for researchers and professionals in the field. To learn how to use it, check the vignettes for a quick tutorial.


## Installation

The pre-released version of ActiGlobe can installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

#### ActiGlobe-dev
```{r eval = FALSE}
# If devtools is not available locally, please download it by removing the number symbol before the 'install.packages' code. 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cwy20030/ActiGlobe")


# To properly install tutorial, please, use the following code
devtools::install_github("cwy20030/ActiGlobe",
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```



Coming soon...
#### ActiGlobe-release
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ActiGlobe")
```

## Citation 
### For the pre-release package ‘ActiGlobe’ in publication:
```{r}
citation("ActiGlobe")
```
To convert to EndNote compatible format, paste the BibTeX entry in [online bibtex-converter] (https://asouqi.github.io/bibtex-converter/) 


## Quick Start - No Time Change

```{r eval = FALSE}
### Load ActiGlobe into R
library(ActiGlobe)
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
### Replace FlyEast with the dataset and specify sampling rate in SR and the start of the recording. 
BdfList = 
BriefSum(df = FlyEast,
         SR = 1/60,
         Start = "2017-10-24 13:45:00")


### Extract the summary report and the enriched data
Bdf <- BdfList$Bdf
df <- BdfList$df
```




```{r eval = FALSE}
### Import the travel log into R and give it a name
TLog <- read.csv("WHERE/YOU/STOREd/THE/TRAVEL/LOG/TEMPLATE/TravelLog_Template.csv")

### Replace the TLog with the name of the travel log assigned
Bdf.adj = TAdjust(Bdf = Bdf, 
                  TLog = TLog)
```
Take a coffee break if needed because ActiGlobe will adjust time shift and anonymize the travel destination to keep participants' privacy.


```{r eval=FALSE}
dfList = Act2Daily(df = df,
                   Bdf = Bdf.adj,
                   VAct = "Activity",
                   VTm = "Time",
                   Incomplete = TRUE,
                   Travel = TRUE)
```
