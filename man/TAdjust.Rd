\title{Adjust Time Shift based on Travel Log}
\usage{
TAdjust(Bdf, TLog, TZ = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Bdf}{A BriefSum object in data.frame}

\item{TLog}{A structured travel log containing date of travel and local time zone. Use `TravelLog()` to generate template.}

\item{TZ}{The time zone when the recording started. (default = "NULL", which will disregard the use of the initial geographical location-based time zone indicator)}
}
\description{
`TAdjust()` is a function that corrects data points and time-shift based on travelling log. Note that it is important to ensure that the UTC-offset value is correct. When in doubt, please use the UTC function or consult IANA table in the package. Daylight saving will not be reassessed as in BriefSum function.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# Import sample data
data(FlyEast)

# Create quick summary of the recording with adjustment for daylight saving.
BdfList <- BriefSum(df = FlyEast,
                    SR = 1/60,
                    Start = "2017-10-19 13:45:00")

# Extract only the summary report
Bdf <- BdfList$Bdf

# Import sample travel Log
data(TLog)

# Adjust time shift based on travel log
Bdf.adj = TAdjust(Bdf, TLog)

# Display the summary
View(Bdf)
View(Bdf.adj) ### Focus on the dates after 2017-11-01
