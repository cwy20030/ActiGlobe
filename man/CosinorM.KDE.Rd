\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric vector of event times in hours. Values are interpreted
modulo 24 and must lie in [0, 24). If not numeric, the function will
attempt to convert using C2T.}

each time point. If not numeric, the function will coerce to numeric.}

(radians). Controls smoothing of the wrapped Gaussian kernel. Default 0.4.}

Default 360 (i.e., one-degree resolution on the \eqn{ 0.2\pi } circle).}

Fit a Gaussian kernel density estimate (KDE) on circular time
(hours of day) weighted by activity and extract cosinor summaries
}
\details{
This function builds a circularized KDE from event times (hours in [0,24))
and non-negative weights (activity). The KDE is computed on a regular grid
over [0, 2*pi) using a wrapped Gaussian kernel with specified bandwidth.
Cosinor parameters are obtained by numerical integration of the KDE:
MESOR is the mean level, \eqn{\beta} and \eqn{\gamma} are the first-harmonic
cosine and sine coefficients, Amplitude is the magnitude of the first harmonic,
and acrophase is the peak time expressed in radian and hour.

 The KDE is computed for each grid angle \eqn{t_g} by summing weighted Gaussian
 densities of the wrapped angular differences \eqn{t_g - \theta_i}, where \eqn{\theta_i}
 are the input times converted to `radian`.

 To mimic the cosinor-style phase mapping for clock time, it integrals KDE-
 predicted density \eqn{\hat{y}(\theta)} (or \eqn{f(\theta)}for normalization) and the complex-weighted
 density \eqn{e^{i\theta }\,\hat{y}(\theta)} (for circular mean/phase)
 over one cycle of a closed circular domain using the trapezoid rule. Note,
 the circularization procedure appends the first grid point to the last after
 shifting it by \eqn{2\pi} to close the circle.

 Together, we can write the equation as,
 \deqn{I\theta=\int _0^{2\pi }f(\theta)\, d\theta}
 \deqn{C=\int _0^{2\pi }e^{i\theta}\, f(\theta)\, d\theta}

 For \eqn{C}, we can then split into linearized cosinor equation:
 \deqn{C = Icos + iIsin}

where,
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{Icos}: Integral of \eqn{f(\theta) * cos(\theta)} with respect to \eqn{(\theta)}.
\deqn{Icos = \int_{\theta}^{2\pi} f(\theta) \cos(\theta)\, d\theta}

  \item \eqn{Isin}: Integral of \eqn{f(\theta) * sin(\theta)} with respect to \eqn{(\theta)}
\deqn{Isin = \int_{\theta}^{2\pi} f(\theta) \sin(\theta)\, d\theta}
}


 Trapezoid-rule discrete forms on grid \eqn{\theta_g} with values \eqn{f_g = f(\theta_g)}:
 \deqn{N\approx \sum_g\frac{f_{g+1}+f_g}{2}\, (\theta_{g+1} - \theta_g)}
 \deqn{C\approx \sum_g\frac{e^{i\theta_{g+1}}f_{g+1}+e^{i\theta_g}f_g}{2}\, (\theta_{g+1} - \theta_g)}




\strong{Conversion of cosinor integrals}:

In a linearized single-phase cosinor model, the equation is often expressed as,
    \deqn{ \hat{y} = M + \beta cos(\frac{2\pi t} {\tau}) + \gamma sin(\frac{2\pi t} {\tau}) + \epsilon }
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{ M }: MESOR (mid-line estimating statistic of rhythm), the intercept
  \item \eqn{\beta = A * cos(\phi)}, estimated coefficient for the cosine term
  \item \eqn{\gamma = -A * sin(\phi)}, estimated coefficient for the sine term
  \item \eqn{ A }: Amplitude, peak deviation from M
  \item \eqn{ t }: Time coordinate within the cycle
  \item \eqn{ \tau }: The assumed period length
  \item \eqn{ \phi }: Acrophase (time-of-peak), computed from fitted sine and cosine coefficients
  \item \eqn{ \epsilon }: error term
}

\strong{For KDE},
we can re-write these parameters since the KDE is projected onto an one cycle clock phase.
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\theta}: the angular (circular) representation of clock time measured in radian.
  \item \eqn{ M }: MESOR (the mean of the KDE over the full cycle, i.e., 24 hours), \eqn{\frac{I\theta}{2\pi}}
  \item \eqn{\beta}: the coefficient of the cosine-weighted integral of the KDE, \eqn{\beta = \frac{Icos}{\pi}}
  \item \eqn{\gamma}: the coefficient of the sine-weighted integral of the KDE, \eqn{\gamma = \frac{Isin}{\pi}}
  \item \eqn{ A }: Amplitude, the peak activity at the first complex moment
  \deqn{C=\pi A\, e^{i\phi}\quad \Rightarrow \quad A=\frac{|C|}{\pi}}
  \item \eqn{\phi}: Acrophase (the mean circular phase), \eqn{ \phi = atan2(-\gamma, \beta) }
}

Notes:
\itemize{
  \item The normalization factors \eqn{1/\pi} and \eqn{1/(2\pi)} follow from orthogonality of \eqn{\cos} and \eqn{\sin} on \eqn{[0,2\pi)} and from the usual least-squares/Fourier coefficient conventions.

  \item While KDE does not assume the number of active-periods from the underlying rest-activity pattern, the algorithm can only extracts the first harmonic equivalent summary of the rest-activity pattern. This is because the time is set to be just one cycle.
