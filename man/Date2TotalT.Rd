\title{Compute Total Time in Each Date (Per Day)}
\usage{
Date2TotalT(DT, TUnit = "hour", TZ = "local")
}
\arguments{
\item{DT}{A vector of class `Date`, `POSIXct` or `POSIXlt`, sorted in ascending order.
Each entry represents the start of an interval.  Internally, the function
appends one extra day beyond the last entry so that the final interval
covers a full 24 h until the next midnight. See \code{as.POSIXct}.}

\item{TUnit}{Character string specifying the unit for the output durations.
Must be one of `"hour"`, `"minute"`, or `"second"`.  Comparison is
case-insensitive.  Default is `"hour"`, meaning the returned values
are in decimal hours.}

\item{TZ}{The time zone when the recording started. (default = "local", which means user's local time zone)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `DT`.  Each element is the
  elapsed time between the corresponding entry in `DT` and the next
  boundary (either the next date-time in `Date`, or midnight following
  the last date), expressed in the units given by `TUnit`.
}
\description{
For an ordered vector of Dates or date-times, `Date2TotalT()` calculates the
interval from each element to the next (and for the last element, to the
following calendar day at midnight) and returns these durations in the
requested time unit.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Two calendar days: returns c(24, 24) hours
Date2TotalT(as.Date(c("2021-01-01", "2021-01-02")), "hour")


# Working in minutes
Date2TotalT(as.POSIXct(c("2021-06-10 08:00:00",
                        "2021-06-10 14:30:00")), "minute")
}

# In seconds (case-insensitive unit name)
Date2TotalT(as.Date("2022-12-31"), "SeCoNd")
