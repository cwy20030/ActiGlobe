\title{Compute Time Gain/Loss due to Daylight Saving Time}
\usage{
DST2GL(DT, TZ = "local")
}
\arguments{
\item{DT}{A vector of class \code{Date}, \code{POSIXct}, or \code{POSIXlt},
sorted in ascending order.  Each element marks the start of a day
boundary.  To capture DST transitions, include at least one day
before and after the expected shift. Note that the time zone should
be specified in the DT. See \code{as.POSIXct}.}

\item{TZ}{The time zone when the recording started. (default = "local",
which means user's local time zone)}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{DT}.  Each
  value is the number of hours that day is longer
  (positive) or shorter (negative) than 24h.  A zero means no DST
  shift on that date.
}
\description{
DST2GL computes, for each date-time entry, how many hours a day
deviates from the standard 24hours because of DST shifts.
Internally it calls \code{Date2TotalT()} in seconds, subtracts
the 86400s of a normal day, and converts the remainder to hours.
}
\examples{
# Example around a typical spring-forward transition (e.g. US second Sunday
# in March)
dates <- as.Date ("2021-03-14")

# On 2021-03-14 clocks jumped forward: day is 23h so output = -1
DST2GL (dates)


# Example around a fall-back transition (e.g. first Sunday in November)
dates <- as.Date ("2021-11-07")

# On 2021-11-07 clocks fall back: day is 25h so output = +1
DST2GL (dates)

# Multiple Dates
sapply (c ("2021-03-13", "2021-03-14", "2021-03-15"), DST2GL)
