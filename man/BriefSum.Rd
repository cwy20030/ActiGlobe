\title{Summarize the Actigraphy Recording by Day}
\usage{
BriefSum(df, SR, Start, TZ = "local")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame of raw actigraphy recording. Both time and activity count
should be included in the `df`. See `VAct` and `VTm` for further detail.}

\item{SR}{The sampling rate of the actigraphy (unit at Hz). Note that Hz should be equal to or less than 1.}

\item{Start}{The starting date and time of the recording in the format as "2021-03-05 18:31:03". See \code{\link[base]{as.POSIXct}} for more details and  \code{\link{DateFormat}} and \code{\link{TimeFormat}} for formatting help.}

\item{TZ}{The time zone when the recording started. (default = "local", which means user's local time zone)}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\itemize{
  \item Bdf A data.frame containing brief summary information of each recording day. Columns include:
    \itemize{
    \item Date calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    \item Epoch epoch length in seconds
    \item UTC dominant UTC offset string (e.g., "UTC+02:00")
    \item TZ_code time zone code (e.g., "EST")
    \item Daylight_Saving logical flag indicating DST for the day
    \item Recording_Start earliest recorded time for the day (HH:MM:SS)
    \item Recording_End latest recorded time for the day (HH:MM:SS)
    \item GL_Offset numeric offset returned by DST2GL() for the day
    \item nDataPoints number of epochs observed for the day
    \item Cumulative_Start_Second cumulative start second from midnight for the day's first epoch
    \item Cumulative_End_Second cumulative end second from midnight for the day's last epoch
    \item Excluded logical flag; TRUE if the day is excluded (e.g., incomplete)
    \item Warning character; warning label when applicable (e.g., "Incomplete Recording", "Time Change")
    }

  \item df The original input df augmented with additional columns (class ActiGlobe, data.frame):
    \itemize{
    \item DateTime POSIXct timestamp for each epoch (tz = TZ)
    \item Date date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
    \item Time time string (HH:MM:SS)
    \item UTC UTC offset string for each epoch
    \item DaylightSaving logical flag per epoch
    \item nPoint cumulative epoch index
    }
}
The function returns a list with both Bdf df = df) and sets classes c("ActiGlobe","data.frame") on both returned data.frames.
}
\description{
`BriefSum()` is a function that summarizes the actigraphy recording by day. It
generates a data.frame where each row holds all metadata for one recording day:
the calendar date, time--zone code, epoch length (seconds), UTC offset,
daylight--saving flag, cumulative start/end seconds from midnight,
recording start/end times (HH:MM:SS), any warning labels (e.g. `Travel`,
`Incomplete Recording`), an exclusion flag, and the expected number of epochs
for a full day.
}
