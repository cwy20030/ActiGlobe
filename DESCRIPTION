Description: A library specifically designed to process longitudinal wearable recordings affected by mid-to-long range travelling. To harmonize recordings, the affected epochs will be adjusted based on the travel log or journal. Along with a graphic and a tabular summary report, the harmonized recordings will be split by day and saved locally (with or without the affected recordings). Besides visual inspection, each report also comes with a summary of time adjusted and several daily rest-activity pattern estimates.
