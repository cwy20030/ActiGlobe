Description: Cross-Continental travel and local daylight saving practice can introduce time shift, leading to biases in interpretation  of the wearable measures when left without adjustment. It streamlines data processing and analyses for longitudinal recordings. Together with additional features such as exporting daily wearable measures and visual reports, this pacakge aims to facilitate research on longitudinal wearable measures. To learn how to use it, check the vignettes for a quick tutorial. This tool is developed based on the methodology described in: Varesco, G. Yao, C. W., Dubé, E., Simonelli, G., Bieuzen, F., (2024) <doi:10.1113/ep092195>.
